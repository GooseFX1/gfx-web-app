            <h3>Jurisdiction and Governing Law</h3>
            <p>
              The parties shall attempt in good faith to mutually resolve any and all disputes, whether of law or
              fact, and of any nature whatsoever arising from or with respect to these Terms. These Terms and any
              dispute or claim arising out of or in connection with the Services or the Website shall be governed
              by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of Hong Kong. Any dispute that is not resolved after
              good faith negotiations may be referred by either party for final, binding resolution by arbitration
              under the arbitration rules of the Hong Kong International Arbitration Centre (“HKIAC”) under the
              HKIAC Administered Arbitration Rules in force when the notice of arbitration is submitted. The law of
              this arbitration clause shall be Hong Kong law. The seat of arbitration shall be Hong Kong. The
              number of arbitrators shall be one (1). The arbitration proceedings shall be conducted in English.
              Any Dispute arising out of or related to these Terms is personal to you and us and will be resolved
              solely through individual arbitration and will not be brought as a class arbitration, class action or
              any other type of representative proceeding. There will be no class arbitration or arbitration in
              which an individual attempts to resolve a dispute as a representative of another individual or group
              of individuals. Further, a dispute cannot be brought as a class or other type of representative
              action, whether within or outside of arbitration, or on behalf of any other individual or group of
              individuals.
            </p>
            <br />

            <h3>Severability</h3>
            <p>
              If any provision of these Terms is determined by any court or other competent authority to be
              unlawful or unenforceable, the other provisions of these Terms will continue in effect. If any
              unlawful or unenforceable provision would be lawful or enforceable if part of it were deleted, that
              part will be deemed to be deleted, and the rest of the provision will continue in effect (unless that
              would contradict the clear intention of the clause, in which case the entirety of the relevant
              provision will be deemed to be deleted).
            </p>
            <br />
