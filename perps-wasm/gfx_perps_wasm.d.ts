/**
* A directive for a single invocation of a Solana program.
*
* An instruction specifies which program it is calling, which accounts it may
* read or modify, and additional data that serves as input to the program. One
* or more instructions are included in transactions submitted by Solana
* clients. Instructions are also used to describe [cross-program
* invocations][cpi].
*
* [cpi]: https://docs.solana.com/developing/programming-model/calling-between-programs
*
* During execution, a program will receive a list of account data as one of
* its arguments, in the same order as specified during `Instruction`
* construction.
*
* While Solana is agnostic to the format of the instruction data, it has
* built-in support for serialization via [`borsh`] and [`bincode`].
*
* [`borsh`]: https://docs.rs/borsh/latest/borsh/
* [`bincode`]: https://docs.rs/bincode/latest/bincode/
*
* # Specifying account metadata
*
* When constructing an [`Instruction`], a list of all accounts that may be
* read or written during the execution of that instruction must be supplied as
* [`AccountMeta`] values.
*
* Any account whose data may be mutated by the program during execution must
* be specified as writable. During execution, writing to an account that was
* not specified as writable will cause the transaction to fail. Writing to an
* account that is not owned by the program will cause the transaction to fail.
*
* Any account whose lamport balance may be mutated by the program during
* execution must be specified as writable. During execution, mutating the
* lamports of an account that was not specified as writable will cause the
* transaction to fail. While _subtracting_ lamports from an account not owned
* by the program will cause the transaction to fail, _adding_ lamports to any
* account is allowed, as long is it is mutable.
*
* Accounts that are not read or written by the program may still be specified
* in an `Instruction`'s account list. These will affect scheduling of program
* execution by the runtime, but will otherwise be ignored.
*
* When building a transaction, the Solana runtime coalesces all accounts used
* by all instructions in that transaction, along with accounts and permissions
* required by the runtime, into a single account list. Some accounts and
* account permissions required by the runtime to process a transaction are
* _not_ required to be included in an `Instruction`s account list. These
* include:
*
* - The program ID &mdash; it is a separate field of `Instruction`
* - The transaction's fee-paying account &mdash; it is added during [`Message`]
*   construction. A program may still require the fee payer as part of the
*   account list if it directly references it.
*
* [`Message`]: crate::message::Message
*
* Programs may require signatures from some accounts, in which case they
* should be specified as signers during `Instruction` construction. The
* program must still validate during execution that the account is a signer.
